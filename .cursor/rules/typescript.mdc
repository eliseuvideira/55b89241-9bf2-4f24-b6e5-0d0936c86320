# TypeScript Guidelines

## Type System
- Always prefer `type` over `interface`
- No `any` - use proper typing or `unknown` if needed
- Make types explicit and clear

## General Approach
- Follow idiomatic TypeScript patterns but keep it simple
- In async functions, always await and return values explicitly
- Use functional methods (map, filter, reduce) when they clarify intent

## Code Style
- Prefer plain functions over classes
- Use early returns and guard clauses to reduce nesting
- Write small, single-purpose functions that do one thing well
- Make it work first, then reason about abstractions if truly needed

## Type Definitions
- Use descriptive type names that explain what they represent
- Prefer simple, flat types over complex nested structures
- Use union types and discriminated unions when appropriate
- Avoid over-engineering type systems

## Error Handling
- Fail loud and fast with descriptive error messages
- Preserve error context and stack traces for debugging
- Handle errors at the appropriate level - don't swallow them
