# Tool Selection Guidelines

## Language Choice
- **Bash/shell scripts** for simple system tasks, automation, and glue code
- **Rust** when you need performance, safety, or system-level control
- **JavaScript/Node.js** when you want hackable scripts, async operations, or ecosystem access
- Use the simplest tool that gets the job done reliably

## Decision Framework
- Start with the simplest tool that can solve the problem
- Choose based on specific requirements, not personal preference
- Consider the ecosystem and libraries available
- Prefer tools that are hackable and composable

## When to Use Each Tool

### Bash/Shell Scripts
- Simple system tasks and automation
- Glue code between different tools
- Text processing with grep/sed/awk
- File system operations
- Quick one-off scripts

### Rust
- Performance-critical applications
- System-level control needed
- Safety requirements
- CLI tools that need to be fast
- When memory safety is important

### JavaScript/Node.js
- Hackable scripts and automation
- Async operations and I/O heavy tasks
- When you need access to the npm ecosystem
- Web scraping and API interactions
- Quick prototyping and data processing
